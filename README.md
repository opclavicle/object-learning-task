# A five-day training discription
This object-learning-task contains two versions of object training code, full traning and short-reactivation.

The whole project and its latest version can be found on https://osf.io/utx6n/.

# Requirements
A computer screen can generate 100 Hz images.
MATLAB
Psychotoolbox

# Full training:

Day 1
object_preview.m
object_learning_Day1.m

Day 2 - Day 4
object_learning_800_Day2_4.m

Day 5
object_preview.m
object_learning_Day5.m

# Short reactivation:
Day 1
object_preview.m
object_learning_Day1.m

Day 2 - Day 4
object_learning_25_Day2_4.m

Day 5
object_preview.m
object_learning_Day5.m

# Example of one trial.
Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) is determined based on an adaptive interleaved 2-down, 1-up staircase procedure. A lower threshold value corresponds to better performance.
